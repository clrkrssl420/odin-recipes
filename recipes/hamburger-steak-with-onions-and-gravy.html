    <h2>Hamburger drizzled with gravy and topped with onion.</h2>
    <p>
      An easy-to-make classic featuring tasty hamburger 'steaks' smothered in
      gravy and onions. Traditionally served with hot white rice or potatoes,
      it's a great way to dress up a pound of ground beef and you probably have
      all the ingredients on hand!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs,
        pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce.
        Form into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties and
        onion in the oil until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per
        side. Remove the beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle flour over the onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom as you stir. Gradually mix in the beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until the gravy thickens. Turn heat to low, return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes.
